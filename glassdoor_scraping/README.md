# GlassdoorScraping

This project presents the means to scraping Glassdoor job ads and gathering information about the skills that are required for a given type job keyword. Using BeautifulSoup, the Glassdoor webpages are parsed. For each job ad, occurences of skills keywords (such as 'Python' or 'deep learning') are searched and counted. By looking for keywords occurences for a big number of job ads, we can order them by frequency and determine which are the most relevant skills for a given job keyword.
