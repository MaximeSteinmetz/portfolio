In essence we do this by:making available new data sources,unlocking the value in data by providing a research service, answering business questions by analysing these datasets,scaling the value in data by building Insight Products: generalising those analyses or anticipating those questions by alerting people to relevant changes before they know to ask.Throughout all these we are using specialist Data Science tools and techniques including Big Data technologies, Intelligence Augmentation and Artificial Intelligence techniques, and insights from the world of Behavioural Science.The quantity of information available for investment research purposes is increasing at such a rate that traditional industry practices and skillsets are unable to absorb and process it. Global trends in digitalisation, social media, open data and technology are all creating vast streams of alternative data that are often highly unstructured and obscure. However, they contain valuable and often unique insights. The Data Insights team aims to find these new and potentially unorthodox datasets, extract the rich, hidden information they contain and use their expertise to enhance traditional fundamental research.Overview of roleThe Data Insights Unit (DIU) is a team of over 25 data scientists and engineers who support investors throughout Schroders, and has been instrumental in deploying modern data science technologies and methods throughout the firm.Data is the lifeblood of business decisions throughout Schroders, and there is a need for data scientists, data engineers and information visualisation experts to sit directly embedded in business teams throughout Schroders supporting evidence based decision making.The opportunity exists for a data professional reporting directly to the Sustainability team, and as an associate member of DIU. The successful applicant will act as the Sustainability team's data subject matter expert. They will collaborate with the Sustainability team members to understand their needs, and propose, implement and maintain data-driven tools to support evidence based decision making.As an associate member of the DIU the applicant will participate in data science knowledge sharing, and both contribute to and draw upon the expertise of the broader Schroders community of data professionals.The applicant will have a strong preference towards working in reproducible data workflow tools such as Jupyter and RMarkdown, but won't be afraid of interacting with complex Excel/VBA models and other legacy data systems. The applicant will take pleasure from finding simple solutions to complex problems.Previous experience in the investment industry would be valuable, but is not required if the applicant can demonstrate a passion for understanding how businesses and markets operate.The role will sit with the Sustainability team and be accountable to them for their project priorities and daily workflow, which may include a mix of engineering, analytical and visualisation tasks. The role will also have a data science coach assigned from the central DIU team, both to ensure they remain connected to larger data initiatives and to ensure they receive the career development support they need.In general it is anticipated that you will be given the opportunity to rotate across to embed in another business team or move into the central DIU function after 2 years embedded in the Sustainability team as part of your ongoing development as a Data Professional.About the Sustainability teamSince we first began to formally consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in our investment processes two decades ago, the scale, breadth and complexity of the Sustainability team's work have has expanded significantly. As the volume of information reported by companies has expanded and analysis of other sources has become possible, our analysis has become increasingly data intensive.The Sustainability team has expanded to 13 people, covering a wide range of activities from thematic research, company analysis, portfolio monitoring, screening, corporate governance actions, client communication and marketing and discussions with policy makers and other stakeholders.Our primary role is to work with analyst and fund manager colleagues to strengthen investment decisions through effective analysis and integration of ESG issues in investment processes.We have developed proprietary tools to provide differentiated information on the roughly 10,000 companies Schroders analysts cover globally. Sourcing, managing, filtering and applying that information in ways that can provide us with distinctive investment insights has become a key role in the Sustainability team. As we have grown, we have developed a growing number of data tools; understanding those tools and whether and how how they can be best integrated into an over-arching data infrastructure is an important element of the role.Within the Sustainability team the role will report to the Head of Sustainability Research.ResponsibilitiesAct as the Sustainability team's advisor and subject matter expert on data science, data engineering, and information visualisation. Act as a bridge to the central DIU where necessary to leverage the expertise of the wider data science community at Schroders when providing this advice.Develop and maintain data pipelines, analyses, and visualisation tools to support evidence-driven decision making in the Sustainability team.Consume, understand, and distribute work from the central DIU that is of interest to the Sustainability team. Providing bespoke analysis and interpretation where needed and/or collaborating with the central DIU team to improve the utility of these tools.Make sure the Sustainability team has ""a voice in the room"" in centralised projects where they should be considered a key stakeholder, and advocate for projects that would benefit that team.Initially, integrate yourself into Sustainability processes, attend their meetings, read the research and develop a good understanding of the research and investment process.

We understand the challenges that retailers face, and we are excited about being able to offer them one of the most innovative solutions in the market: a platform that delivers powerful customer insights, alongside tools to leverage that insight to market to them more effectively across numerous channels.  With some heavy hitters backing us, and a collection of leading retailers as our client base, we are looking for a Senior Data Scientist with a strong knowledge of Machine Learning to join our growing engineering team. Reporting directly to the CTO, you will guide and advise the team on how we use machine learning to stay ahead of the market and build a strong platform that serves both current and future Ometrian clients.

We work closely with the Product Owner and Product Managers.We run two-week sprints, aiming to split time evenly between new features, technical maintenance and client-specific work.As we are a small team we all punch above our weight and have varied experience, roles and responsibilities. One of our frontend developers is also one of our main Docker and Kubernetes experts!Most of the team use Macbooks, but both Windows and Linux are represented: you can pick your tools, and we'll provide you with your preferred hardware when you join. Here are some of the challenges we are thinking about right now: Structuring our systems for scale: we're building a modern microservices based infrastructure that allows for autonomy of teams, fault tolerance, and reliable monitoring and alerting across services. We are looking to grow both the team and our client-base massively in the next few years. How can we make sure that the system can keep up with the data growth? How can we make sure our growing team can continue to onboard clients efficiently as we grow?Optimising our reporting and inference engine: we need to run analytics over millions of data points in real-time. Our clients expect to be able to run complex segmentation queries across their entire dataset, which are fundamentally uncachable, and get a response in less than 5 seconds.Some of our systems have very high availability requirements. How can we make sure that our user facing HTTP services are always available so that no customers of our clients are ever given a bad experience?We will be increasingly working with US clients in the forthcoming year. How can we maintain a EU and US point of presence and keep releases in sync and both sets of infrastructure reliable with one team?Tools & Stack: Our clients interact with the Ometria platform through a single page web app, which uses the AmpersandJS framework, with a separate section in React.  The app communicates with the backend platform through various Python 3 APIs that use Flask. Python powers most of our backend services and workers, which perform tasks like importing and processing data, managing campaigns, sending emails and syncing data to third parties.  Our infrastructure runs on AWS, and is configured using Terraform. We use Docker and Kubernetes to deploy our services onto AWS EC2 nodes.  Our data is stored in Postgres (which runs on i3 instances to take advantage of fast NVMe SSD drives) and Redshift, and we use various queueing and messaging tools, including Google Pub/Sub, AWS Kinesis, AWS SQS, Beanstalk, Celery and Gearman.  Some older services are written in PHP (but we are working to rewrite these!), and if you squint you will see a small (but increasing) amount of Go. Requirements About you: Expertise and knowledge - you have a deep understanding how to apply machine learning principles to similar problem domains, and can demonstrate knowledge of data science approaches and uses.Structured and analytical approach - you strive for correctness and to be able to back-up your experimental results.Attention to detail - you take pride in your work and you don’t cut corners. You are able to think holistically as well as get lost in the detail, and your quality standards are high.Creativity and passion - you share these interests and are hungry to learn about what others are doing, as well as get immersed in what Ometria does and the market it’s in.Problem solver - you enjoy working in a team, and independently, to solve problems in a scalable way.Programming Languages - you have experience with Python and have used common numerical packages (such as tensorflow, pandas, scikit-learn) and have experience with SQL.Benefits We believe that it's awesome to be here.

Data Engineer," Bridge International Academies – Londres, Angleterre","Londres, Angleterre",https://www.glassdoor.fr/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=2409&ao=4128&s=58&guid=000001661f7b4a5ebfa588d747c7d627&src=GD_JOB_AD&t=SR&extid=1&exst=OL&ist=&ast=OL&vt=w&slr=true&rtp=0&cs=1_6cd7a3cc&cb=1538126465984&jobListingId=2546688297,"Who We Are Bridge believes every child has the right to high quality education and works in partnership with governments, communities, parents and teachers to deliver education to over 100,000 children in underserved communities across Africa and Asia.  Bridge leverages in-depth teacher training and support, advanced lesson plans and wireless technology to provide pupils with a meaningful and life-changing education.  Globally, there is an education crisis. Around 263 million children and young people are not in school and the number of primary school aged children not in school is increasing. Bridge is committed to helping tackle this through a data driven, evidence based approach that delivers strong schools and a great education for all. The Bridge Approach Education is in crisis in many countries around the world. It is estimated that 264 million children and young people are out of school, and 330 million children are in school but not learning. In addition, an extra 69 million teachers are needed to achieve the 2030 UN education goals.  Many education systems are plagued with inadequate materials and poor management systems, all leading to chronic teacher absenteeism and a lack of learning. Education reform is challenging but it is urgently required if we are to prevent another generation of children missing out. So, we work in partnership with governments, NGOs and non-state actors to address the huge education imbalance between what is available and what is needed right now we work to bridge the gap.  We believe parents have the right to choose a school for their children and we enable families to enjoy seeing their children learn, improve and flourish at Bridge schools. We locate our schools in some of the most disadvantaged communities in the world. Families in our communities can be earning just $1.90 per person a day; a level the World Bank notes is at extreme poverty. By putting learning at the centre of all we do, Bridge has become an extremely popular choice for underserved families and low-income communities.  With plans to enrol ten million students ten years from now, Bridge offers a tremendous opportunity to grow with one of the worlds most exciting and ambitious social enterprises, with leadership roles available across a number of competencies and geographies. Tech at Bridge Technology plays a critical role at Bridge in enabling us to provide education at massive scale and low cost it's one of the key elements that gives us the ability to deliver what no one else can. Tech spans several key functions, from the hardware and software that our academies use to run all aspects of teaching and management, including mobile payments, to the systems that enable our country headquarters to manage massive local operations, to the data backbone that informs all of our strategic and tactical decision making. Its a lot of custom software development and a lot of back office systems.  We've got a ridiculously ambitious mission at Bridge, and it's a place where passionate technologists have a chance to directly change the world. No kidding.About the RoleBridge has been data-driven from its inception, using a build-measure-learn approach to all aspects of service delivery. As a scale model business, we have an unprecedented opportunity to bring statistical power to all aspects of an educational operation, from the academics team using randomised controlled trials to validate the best teaching methods to the schools team understanding which factors contribute to teacher turnover to operational teams striving to improve our service delivery efficiency.  However, we have reached an inflection point where we need to take our data game to the next level. Instead of just providing data to our various departments, we need to start bringing to bear more sophisticated techniques to unlock the potential of our significant data sets. While we collect tens of thousands of data points every term from each of our academies from the time spent on each page of a lesson to the billing and payment history of every pupil we are yet to fully realise the potential energy of these data sets.
