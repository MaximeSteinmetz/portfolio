In essence we do this by:making available new data sources,unlocking the value in data by providing a research service, answering business questions by analysing these datasets,scaling the value in data by building Insight Products: generalising those analyses or anticipating those questions by alerting people to relevant changes before they know to ask.Throughout all these we are using specialist Data Science tools and techniques including Big Data technologies, Intelligence Augmentation and Artificial Intelligence techniques, and insights from the world of Behavioural Science.The quantity of information available for investment research purposes is increasing at such a rate that traditional industry practices and skillsets are unable to absorb and process it. Global trends in digitalisation, social media, open data and technology are all creating vast streams of alternative data that are often highly unstructured and obscure. However, they contain valuable and often unique insights. The Data Insights team aims to find these new and potentially unorthodox datasets, extract the rich, hidden information they contain and use their expertise to enhance traditional fundamental research.Overview of roleThe Data Insights Unit (DIU) is a team of over 25 data scientists and engineers who support investors throughout Schroders, and has been instrumental in deploying modern data science technologies and methods throughout the firm.Data is the lifeblood of business decisions throughout Schroders, and there is a need for data scientists, data engineers and information visualisation experts to sit directly embedded in business teams throughout Schroders supporting evidence based decision making.The opportunity exists for a data professional reporting directly to the Sustainability team, and as an associate member of DIU. The successful applicant will act as the Sustainability team's data subject matter expert. They will collaborate with the Sustainability team members to understand their needs, and propose, implement and maintain data-driven tools to support evidence based decision making.As an associate member of the DIU the applicant will participate in data science knowledge sharing, and both contribute to and draw upon the expertise of the broader Schroders community of data professionals.The applicant will have a strong preference towards working in reproducible data workflow tools such as Jupyter and RMarkdown, but won't be afraid of interacting with complex Excel/VBA models and other legacy data systems. The applicant will take pleasure from finding simple solutions to complex problems.Previous experience in the investment industry would be valuable, but is not required if the applicant can demonstrate a passion for understanding how businesses and markets operate.The role will sit with the Sustainability team and be accountable to them for their project priorities and daily workflow, which may include a mix of engineering, analytical and visualisation tasks. The role will also have a data science coach assigned from the central DIU team, both to ensure they remain connected to larger data initiatives and to ensure they receive the career development support they need.In general it is anticipated that you will be given the opportunity to rotate across to embed in another business team or move into the central DIU function after 2 years embedded in the Sustainability team as part of your ongoing development as a Data Professional.About the Sustainability teamSince we first began to formally consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in our investment processes two decades ago, the scale, breadth and complexity of the Sustainability team's work have has expanded significantly. As the volume of information reported by companies has expanded and analysis of other sources has become possible, our analysis has become increasingly data intensive.The Sustainability team has expanded to 13 people, covering a wide range of activities from thematic research, company analysis, portfolio monitoring, screening, corporate governance actions, client communication and marketing and discussions with policy makers and other stakeholders.Our primary role is to work with analyst and fund manager colleagues to strengthen investment decisions through effective analysis and integration of ESG issues in investment processes.We have developed proprietary tools to provide differentiated information on the roughly 10,000 companies Schroders analysts cover globally. Sourcing, managing, filtering and applying that information in ways that can provide us with distinctive investment insights has become a key role in the Sustainability team. As we have grown, we have developed a growing number of data tools; understanding those tools and whether and how how they can be best integrated into an over-arching data infrastructure is an important element of the role.Within the Sustainability team the role will report to the Head of Sustainability Research.ResponsibilitiesAct as the Sustainability team's advisor and subject matter expert on data science, data engineering, and information visualisation. Act as a bridge to the central DIU where necessary to leverage the expertise of the wider data science community at Schroders when providing this advice.Develop and maintain data pipelines, analyses, and visualisation tools to support evidence-driven decision making in the Sustainability team.Consume, understand, and distribute work from the central DIU that is of interest to the Sustainability team. Providing bespoke analysis and interpretation where needed and/or collaborating with the central DIU team to improve the utility of these tools.Make sure the Sustainability team has ""a voice in the room"" in centralised projects where they should be considered a key stakeholder, and advocate for projects that would benefit that team.Initially, integrate yourself into Sustainability processes, attend their meetings, read the research and develop a good understanding of the research and investment process.

In essence we do this by:making available new data sources,unlocking the value in data by providing a research service, answering business questions by analysing these datasets,scaling the value in data by building Insight Products: generalising those analyses or anticipating those questions by alerting people to relevant changes before they know to ask.Throughout all these we are using specialist Data Science tools and techniques including Big Data technologies, Intelligence Augmentation and Artificial Intelligence techniques, and insights from the world of Behavioural Science.The quantity of information available for investment research purposes is increasing at such a rate that traditional industry practices and skillsets are unable to absorb and process it. Global trends in digitalisation, social media, open data and technology are all creating vast streams of alternative data that are often highly unstructured and obscure. However, they contain valuable and often unique insights. The Data Insights team aims to find these new and potentially unorthodox datasets, extract the rich, hidden information they contain and use their expertise to enhance traditional fundamental research.Overview of roleThe Data Insights Unit (DIU) is a team of over 25 data scientists and engineers who support investors throughout Schroders, and has been instrumental in deploying modern data science technologies and methods throughout the firm.Data is the lifeblood of business decisions throughout Schroders, and there is a need for data scientists, data engineers and information visualisation experts to sit directly embedded in business teams throughout Schroders supporting evidence based decision making.The opportunity exists for a data professional reporting directly to the Sustainability team, and as an associate member of DIU. The successful applicant will act as the Sustainability team's data subject matter expert. They will collaborate with the Sustainability team members to understand their needs, and propose, implement and maintain data-driven tools to support evidence based decision making.As an associate member of the DIU the applicant will participate in data science knowledge sharing, and both contribute to and draw upon the expertise of the broader Schroders community of data professionals.The applicant will have a strong preference towards working in reproducible data workflow tools such as Jupyter and RMarkdown, but won't be afraid of interacting with complex Excel/VBA models and other legacy data systems. The applicant will take pleasure from finding simple solutions to complex problems.Previous experience in the investment industry would be valuable, but is not required if the applicant can demonstrate a passion for understanding how businesses and markets operate.The role will sit with the Sustainability team and be accountable to them for their project priorities and daily workflow, which may include a mix of engineering, analytical and visualisation tasks. The role will also have a data science coach assigned from the central DIU team, both to ensure they remain connected to larger data initiatives and to ensure they receive the career development support they need.In general it is anticipated that you will be given the opportunity to rotate across to embed in another business team or move into the central DIU function after 2 years embedded in the Sustainability team as part of your ongoing development as a Data Professional.About the Sustainability teamSince we first began to formally consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in our investment processes two decades ago, the scale, breadth and complexity of the Sustainability team's work have has expanded significantly. As the volume of information reported by companies has expanded and analysis of other sources has become possible, our analysis has become increasingly data intensive.The Sustainability team has expanded to 13 people, covering a wide range of activities from thematic research, company analysis, portfolio monitoring, screening, corporate governance actions, client communication and marketing and discussions with policy makers and other stakeholders.Our primary role is to work with analyst and fund manager colleagues to strengthen investment decisions through effective analysis and integration of ESG issues in investment processes.We have developed proprietary tools to provide differentiated information on the roughly 10,000 companies Schroders analysts cover globally. Sourcing, managing, filtering and applying that information in ways that can provide us with distinctive investment insights has become a key role in the Sustainability team. As we have grown, we have developed a growing number of data tools; understanding those tools and whether and how how they can be best integrated into an over-arching data infrastructure is an important element of the role.Within the Sustainability team the role will report to the Head of Sustainability Research.ResponsibilitiesAct as the Sustainability team's advisor and subject matter expert on data science, data engineering, and information visualisation. Act as a bridge to the central DIU where necessary to leverage the expertise of the wider data science community at Schroders when providing this advice.Develop and maintain data pipelines, analyses, and visualisation tools to support evidence-driven decision making in the Sustainability team.Consume, understand, and distribute work from the central DIU that is of interest to the Sustainability team. Providing bespoke analysis and interpretation where needed and/or collaborating with the central DIU team to improve the utility of these tools.Make sure the Sustainability team has ""a voice in the room"" in centralised projects where they should be considered a key stakeholder, and advocate for projects that would benefit that team.Initially, integrate yourself into Sustainability processes, attend their meetings, read the research and develop a good understanding of the research and investment process.

Traditional bank loans have slow application processes, inflexible terms and burdensome criteria. In contrast, we use cutting-edge technology to offer flexible access to credit with a five minute application process and a decision in hours.  Since 2012, we've lent over £400 million to over 20,000 businesses across Europe. Our customers include everything from cafés to car dealers, salons to solicitors. Along the way we have built a sophisticated technology platform, won numerous awards and grown a fun, and vibrant team.  However, we’re still near the start of our journey – our aim is to finance a million small businesses within a decade and so we need more smart, hands-on people to help us reach this goal.  About the role:iwoca is the market leader in accurately lending to small businesses. By ingesting, processing and making sense of a huge variety of data on each application we understand our customer’s risk profile better than anyone else. This allows us to extend credit to the small businesses that need it.  A large portion of our existing processing is automated, especially in data collection, but to be able to serve our customers (both in speed and precision) we would like to automate more of the high-level analysis, much of which is currently manual.  Within our tech & analytics department we are building a machine learning unit dedicated to automating these higher-level tasks.
