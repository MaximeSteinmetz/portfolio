# Lichess data exploration

Exploration of the lichess dataset. More than 100GB of chess games data.

PySpark is used to process the data into a clean format. We go from a raw line by line text file to a PySpark SQL DataFrame on which queries are used to question the data

There is an exploration part, which leads to interesting insights about lichess games.

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for details.
