# Loan foreclosure prediction

This project is about applying machine learning models to a dataset defining the characteristics of US mortgage loans. The goal is to predict which loans are going to be foreclosed, by using the informations available at the time the loan is accepted by the bank. 

Prior to running machine learning algorithms, the data has to be processed:
 - Raw data is splitted in several .txt files that have to be concatenated
 - Data has to be cleaned from missing values
 - Categorical vairables converted into dummy variables
 - Classes have to be rebalanced by resampling

Please refer to the Jupyter notebook for the detailed study
